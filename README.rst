Tike
####

Tike is a toolbox for tomographic reconstruction of 3D objects from
ptychography data.

The aim of Tike is to provide fast and accurate implementations of a wide
variety of reconstruction algorithms, and to provide a common platform for
the synchrotron research community.


Features
========
- Simulation of arbitrary scanning geometries in 3D
- 3D object reconstruction from ptychography data
- Algorithms for imaging thick objects
